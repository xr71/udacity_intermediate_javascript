/*
 *
 * Functions, objects, and this are all interconnected. When invoking 
 * constructor functions with the new operator, a this variable is set 
 * to the newly-created object. When invoking a method on an object, 
 * this is set to that object itself. And when invoking a function 
 * in a browser environment, this is set to window, otherwise known as the global object.
 *
 * Along with all this, there is yet one more set of ways to invoke 
 * functions: with apply(), and with call(). Both methods share quite 
 * a few similarities, and they each allow us to specify how we want to 
 * set this. We'll take a look at each of them in detail next!
